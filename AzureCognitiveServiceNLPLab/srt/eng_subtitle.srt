1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh oh, I think today

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Introduce azure machine learning to all your classmates

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
part of that if everyone

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Uh, have to watch the little video above and you'll know above

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There are some very, uh, powerful machine learning

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
some features ah we uh before

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That introduces a zero code way to do it uh

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A computer vision task then what follows I think

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Give everyone a more professional part of everyone know what we do

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Machine learning will encounter a situation is er

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We may not have gpu or some

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Machine learning platforms are also very much built in the environment

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Inconvenient but if you get through the azure can be quick

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Go quickly to get the job done you can't

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Need to pay attention to some of your entire uh platform

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Build the situation ah installation ah profile and so on

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You can start some machine learning above your azure

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Some services include saying logos include saying pythons

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The environment also has some gpu some calculation

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Some uh use here words I would like to introduce to you

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Azure's whole uh machine learning one of the services

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Platform good first of all we go back to azure portal

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There's going to be a lot of it in this slope

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Some uh resources some create us too

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
First of all, we're going to create an azure and about the machine

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Service uh resources we go to choose ai

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Add machine learning and then define it here

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Column uh inside uh the first one is us

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The machine learning service then clicks To create that one

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Take him and you'll be guided to a machine learning

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
One of the creations here faces you can

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Choose the original resource group or yourself

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You can create another one that you might want to create

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A machine learning name er is like ldemo

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh then you

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You can select your region then why your stored account should have

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Storage because, uh, it can help you if it's in there

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
To save your er Jubit's logo is also relevant

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Some uh about the data sorting ah uh there's another

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Some related er includes talking about some of the exercises of training

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And some uh keys

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
These are all very useful of course you need not go

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Register a container ah can also default to not

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Use ah here we don't need to start then

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Go and create that in the creation

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
In the process he will go and do our verification

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Step a little if

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If the validation passes then you can go directly to create when

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Anne's

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
uh azuremachinelearning service up er

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Once it's been created, he'll tell you to go

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Related resources inside that you can see

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Get oh here if he has put the resources you need

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The group has been bound to the space that is of course also stored

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
There are positions above that have made some bindings ah here

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
face you can go directly to use your azuremachine

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
a platform for learning on this ah

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We can click on it depending on the situation

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Ah, the url in this studio

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Go and jump to our azure machine service

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
One uh related one connects that one

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Then you can create love for you according to your needs

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Uh, some public, uh, some related to machine learning

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Work example uh we may need to do machine learning

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
To logo then you this time you may be going to uh

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Do the operation of logo ah here you can go

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Add ah new logo can also be uh

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Go inside the sample because you're going to study then you can

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Above go uh learn a uh add

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
How about a er-related one going

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Use mlexperiment to operate that time

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can go to a folder in xsample

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Clone it on top of your local like I'm in

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Here is a catalogue of looking fees ah

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's my name and then clone him

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Put the file inside uhsample uh clone the truth uh

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
One directory above and then the words below it seem

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Said I was going to er mess up one of my sdka

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
ml sdk then I click on him

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
file when you can find ah his ml

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Ah, English is relatively tall but not afraid

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Ah, uh, all of them

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
How to go uh to take advantage of this

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Azuremachinelearning does some model training

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's when people know you need to do something relevant

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
some of the calculations uh then you this take

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He'll tell you what to do if you don't do the calculation

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Choose a er new one

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Here you can choose is gpu and cpu

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Thecomputer because I'm here for that

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Uh there's one you can use called m

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
When choosing gpu you can choose is er

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
m60 a gpu a calculation of course you

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If it's a little saving, because you have students

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Account ah has a hundred knives of a uh calculation

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
A support for that time you can choose ah one

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Gpu ah every hour to count 1.5

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Eight dollars, 1.5558 knives

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Ah, a calculation ah so here in the words

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Ah, you can do it according to your needs and this

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It doesn't cost you to stop it when you don't use it

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So you have to look at your own reality of course you

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It can be used in the words of cpucpu it has a lot of cu

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Uh--- the arithmetic is on it like I am here

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Used a er plain called ds3v2

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
A cpu it is zero one four knives ah

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Uh four-and-a-half knives ah as every hour

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The calculation of which I create here is also false

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
uh to create ah uh it

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Will create a success will tell you oh this thing is how

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Son of the uh you can see ha

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh, and you don't need to put in your calculations

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Itch and you can go uh do a lot

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Some machine learning-related work is else here

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Face I would like to introduce to you a very interesting

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The thing is his game and we're waiting to calculate

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, this calculation er-creative start-up

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You can go to the game when you get up

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What is this third?

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Windows above well we can be very simple

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Go drag and drop some controls to complete some windows

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The interface ah here in the words you can

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Through ah related uh one

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
uh drag uh to finish machine learning inside related

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Some knowledge of some creation as I am here for everyone

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You can see that I have selected an image recognition action

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And then, uh, if you choose this game you can watch

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to it from the graphic image hurry ah to the image

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Some transition to some categories of image pictures

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Training is done by dragging

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Then he'll make machine learning even more uh

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Automation is so good

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, uh through azure machine learning service you can uh through

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Designer to complete the steps of your machine learning

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It is also another popular use in the industry

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
automl to complete related tasks

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It is also very convenient to use then we go back

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Our logo to see if he's finished

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Good when we calculate

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
After the force is created ah you can see that he will go

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Remind you oh this calculation has been created successfully then

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
At this time, uh, people will be worried

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Alas, my calculation is to use the three environment to give you an example

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can use python 3.6

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Of course, the environment can also use 3.8 ah and there is another

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It also supports r as a support for this calculation force so

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's very convenient to be here

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You can go online through uhlogo

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This logo goes to add code and then runs so

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Services via auremachinelearning, uh

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
can let your machine learn er uh learn

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Or the experimental environment gets a boost and

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's going to be done without paying

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Finish this thing ah hope that all the students ah immediately

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Go and try it, uh, through the azure

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Machine learning services to complete your uhai

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Learning ah can also be used as a learning environment ah

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you
